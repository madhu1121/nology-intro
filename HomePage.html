                Hello Everyone!
                <br>
                I am Madhusmita Biswal(Call me "Madhu").
                I belong to Odisha State which is situated in eastern part of India.
                I have graduated in computer science and engineereing from University college of Engineering, Burla in the year 2008.I have started my career with Paypal (CSC India) in the year 2008. Then I moved into Tata Consultancy services, Barclays. And I joined Deutsche Bank on September, 2018.
                I have 13 years of experience predominantly on Test Automation using selenium,java,typescript. Briefly I have worked on devops using jenkins, data science using python. I have done multiple POCs using various tools and technologies, mostly related to test automation.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I belong to a big fat Indian family. And due to pandemic, Currently I am staying with my family in Odisha. My husband is also a software engineer. We have a 5 years old daughter who keeps us very busy for 365 days :)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My hobbies are reading books, learning new languages and cultures, spending time in sea & sand.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I never got an opportunity to work in application development. From last few months, I was learning bits and pieces of HTML CSS and javascript, But these things are vast enough to make a sequence of learning by myself. Also, I was not getting dedicated time. Hence, this came as a golden opportunity to learn all the new technologies used for an application development. I look forward to utilize these 3 months to upgrade myself and fulfil my long awaited dream.
